# density-fluctuation
For review.

All codes are tested in Ubuntu 14.04.

Using "Ricker_model.m" and "Ricker_model_GPU.m" to simulate Ricker model in MATLAB; using "Ricker2D_GPU.ipynb" and "Ricker2D_numba_CPU.ipynb" to simulate Ricker model in python.

Using "optimized.zip" to simulate Ising model with C++.

Using "Data.mat" and "Analysis_DF_withoutmale.m" to analyze the data of pistachio tree yield.

Using "Raster_TL_DF_Convolution.m" to calculate density fluctuation with the convolution method, and using "Vector_TL_DF_square_mark.m" to calculate density fluctuation with the throwing boxes method.
